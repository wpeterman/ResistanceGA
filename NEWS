ResistanceGA 4.1-0.12
--------

* Updated GA dependency

ResistanceGA 4.1-0.10
--------
* Multisurface k-value bug resolved 

ResistanceGA 4.1-0.3 to 4.1-0.9
--------
* Numerous bug fixes and minor updates. Fixed error causing miscalculation of parameters when using multisurface approach.

ResistanceGA 4.1-0.2
--------
* Extensive updates. Have now fully implemented the Islands optimization approach from the GA package (gaisl), as well as the hybrid local optimization features. Setting `gaisl = TRUE` has great potential to vastly speed up optimization.

ResistanceGA 4.1-0.1
--------
* Continued debugging and upgrading of functions

ResistanceGA 4.1-0
--------
* It is now possible to optimize with Circuitscape run through Julia. This requires that Julia is properly installed on your system. Potential benefits of this approach include (i) ability to run CS in parallel; (ii) ability to run genetic algorithm in parallel; (iii) ability to run both CS and genetic algorithm in parallel; (iv) Julia implementation of CS is slightly faster than original CS program. This has only been tested on a Windows machine to date. Features of the Julia implementation that are supposed to improve speed (e.g., cholmod solver, parallelization when solving large rasters does not seem to scale).

ResistanceGA 4.0-6
--------
* Numerous code updates
* Fixed bug in function used to determine k (number of parameters used for calculating AICc) in multi surface and all combinations analyses. Was previously underestimating the number of parameters when using the default settings. NOTE: This should not substantively change results using previous versions.
* Have updated code to be more robust when restricting optimization to specific transformations.

--------
* Updated function syntax for ga
* Added pipe operator
* Updated transformation selection function for multisurface optimization

--------
* Fixed a bug with `GA.prep` when running `all_comb`
* Fixed typos in documentation

ResistanceGA 4.0-1
--------
* Minor bug fixes and error message updates.
* Updated the citation

ResistanceGA 4.0-0
--------
* This is the official release of the development version that includes the `all_comb` function, as well as a generic `mlpe_rga` function for flexibly fitting MLPE mixed effects models.

ResistanceGA 3.1-4
--------
* Updated Plot.trans function to generate marginal plots for response curve transformations. This uses the ggExtra package
* Have implemented an `all_combs` function to facilitate the running of a full analysis from a single function: replicate runs of single and multisurface combinations, bootstrap resampling of results.
* Gaussian smoothing now done with spatstat rather than smoothie package

ResistanceGA 3.1-3
--------
* Default setting for k.value in GA.prep is now 2, meaning that AICc is calculated based on the number of parameters optimized, plus 1 for the mixed effects model intercept.
* Typos corrected throughout documentation
* Updated vignette

ResistanceGA 3.1-2
--------
* Updated `Run_gdistance` function to apply geoCorrections specic to costDistance and commuteDistance

ResistanceGA 3.0-4
--------
* Default objective function for optimization has been set to log-likelihood (LL)
* Surfaces can be optimized with `commuteDistance` from the `gdistance` package. This is nearly equivalent to CIRCUITSCAPE (except for different scaling of values), is faster, and allows optimization to be done in parallel.
* It is possible to optimize a kernel smoothing scaling parameter (set `scale = TRUE` in the `GA.prep` function). This applies a Gaussian smoothing function from the `smoothie` package.
* A new function was added to facilitate a bootstrap AIC analysis of optimized resistance surfaces. See the vignette for a worked example. (`Resist.boot`)

ResistanceGA 3.0-3
--------
* Minor bug fixes

ResistanceGA 3.0-2
=======
* Fix issue in SCALE returning infinite values (#3).

--------
* It is now possible to run ResistanceGA with CIRCUITSCAPE on Linux (confirmed with Ubuntu)
* Default method for optimization is now log likelihood (LL)

ResistanceGA 3.0-0
--------
* Updates to the vignette
* It is now possible to choose whether to optimize using AIC, R2, or log likelihood (LL) by specifying 'method' in `GA.prep`. The default is still AIC.
* Is is now possible to specify how the number of parameters, k, is determined by setting `k.value` in `GA.prep`. The default is that k is equal to the number of parameters optimized, plus the the number of surfaces, plus the intercept.
* The number of parameters, k, is now reported in the 'All_Results_Table.csv'
* A number of smaller errors have been corrected
* AICc is now calculated based upon the number of sampled populations in the analysis, rather than the number of pairwise comparisons between populations (as was the case in previous versions).
* The syntax of the `CS.prep` and `gdist.prep` functions has been updated. Formerly `n.POPS` is now `n.Pops`

* Fixed an error in Combine_Surfaces

ResistanceGA 2.0-3
---------
* GA.prep can now handle RasterLayer and RasterStack objects for optimization using least cost paths
* Added `rescale` feature to `Combine_Surfaces`. The default is TRUE, which will rescale the combined resistance surface so that the minimum resistance value is 1. This is accomplished by dividing by the minimum value in the resistance surface. This makes the comparison of optimized resistance surfaces easier since they often optimize to different solutions that are perfectly correlated in terms of relative resistance.
* It is now possible to use a sample point grid (.asc file) to specify spatial sample locations when using `CS.prep`. This format is exported by the 'export to CIRCUITSCAPE' tool in ArcGIS
* Fixed error in `Plot.trans` Reverse Monomolecular equation

ResistanceGA 2.0-2
