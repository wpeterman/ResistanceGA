See argument \code{optimArgs} for further details and finer control. Setting to TRUE has the potential to improve optimization accuracy, but will increase optimization time.}

\item{optim.method}{The method to be used among those available in \code{\link[stats]{optim}} function. By default, the BFGS algorithm with box constraints is used, where the bounds are those provided in the \code{ga()} function call. Further methods are available as described in the Details section in help(optim).}

\item{poptim}{A value in the range [0,1] specifying the probability of performing a local search at each iteration of GA (default 0.0). Only change if your optimization is relatively fast.}

\item{pressel}{A value in the range [0,1] specifying the pressure selection (default 1.00). The local search is started from a random solution selected with probability proportional to fitness. High values of pressel tend to select the solutions with the largest fitness, whereas low values of pressel assign quasi-uniform probabilities to any solution.}

\details{
Only files that you wish to optimize, either in isolation or simultaneously, should be included in the specified \code{ASCII.dir}. If you wish to optimize different combinations of surfaces, different directories containing these surfaces must be created. It is preferable to provide a RasterStack.

When \code{scale = TRUE}, the standard deviation of the Gaussian kernel smoothing function (sigma) will also be optimized during optimization. Only continuous surfaces or binary categorical surfaces (e.g., forest/no forest; 1/0) surfaces can be optimized when \code{scale = TRUE}

\code{scale.surfaces} can be used to specify which surfaces to apply kernel smoothing to during multisurface optimization. For example, \code{scale.surfaces = c(1, 0, 1)} will result in the first and third surfaces being optimized with a kernel smoothing function, while the second surface will not be scaled. The order of surfaces will match either the order of the raster stack, or alphabetical order when reading in from a directory.

\code{min.scale} defaults to a minimum of 0.01. During optimization, whenever the scaling factor (sigma) is less than 0.5, ResistanceGA will not apply scaling. In this way, it is possible for a surface to not be scaled.

The Default for \code{k.value} is 2, which sets k equal to the number of parameters optimized, plus 1 for the intercept term. Prior to version 3.0-0, \code{k.value} could not be specified by the user and followed setting 2, such that k was equal to the number of parameters optimized plus the intercept term.

\code{cont.shape} can take values of "Increase", "Decrease", or "Peaked". If you believe a resistance surface is related to your response in a particular way, specifying this here may decrease the time to optimization. \code{cont.shape} is used to generate an initial set of parameter values to test during optimization. If specified, a greater proportion of the starting values will include your believed relationship. If unspecified (the Default), a completely random set of starting values will be generated.

If it is desired that only certain transformations be assessed for continuous surfaces, then this can be specified using \code{select.trans}. By default, only monomolecular transformations will be assessed for continuous surfaces unless otherwise specified. Specific transformations can be specified by providing a vector of values (e.g., \code{c(1,3,5)}), with values corresponding to the equation numbers as detailed in \code{\link[ResistanceGA]{Resistance.tran}}. If multiple rasters are to be optimized from the same directory, then a list of transformations must be provided in the order that the raster surfaces will be assessed. For example:\cr
\code{select.trans = list("M", "A", "R", c(5,6))}\cr
will result in surface one only being optimized with Monomolecular transformations, surface two with all transformations, surface three with only Ricker transformations, and surface four with Reverse Ricker and Reverse Monomolecular only. If a categorical surface is among the rasters to be optimized, it is necessary to specify \code{NA} to accommodate this.

\code{cat.levels} defaults to 15. This means that when a raster surface has <= 15 unique levels, it will be treated as a categorical surface in the analysis. This value can be increased, but optimization of surfaces with many levels may take more time. Additionally, depending upon the prevalence and configuration of categorical features and spatial sample locations, some levels are likely to be poorly estimated. This may be evident if estimated resistance values vary substantially between runs of ResistanceGA.

Setting \code{gaisl = TRUE} has the potential greatly reduce the optimization run time, potentially with greater accuracy. This is a distributed multiple-population GA, where the population is partitioned into several subpopulations and assigned to separated islands. Independent GAs are executed in each island, and only occasionally sparse exchanges of individuals are performed among the islands. 

It is recommended to first run GA optimization with the default settings
